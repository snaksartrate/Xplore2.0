## Task 3:

You have have been given an image of a person's face. The image contains 4 hidden letters in different facial features of the person.
```The task is to find the hidden letters using OpenCV and Haarcascade.```

The code to be implemented is required to crop the right areas containing the letters. OpenCV and Haarcascade cannot identify the letters or their positions , they can only help to identify the facial features. You have to crop the features such that those cropped images contain the letters.

For Example:

**The actual identification of the letter is not required to be done by your code.**

***Also please do not try to manually crop the features if you are able to see the hidden letters beforehand.***
